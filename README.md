# Getting started
You can have a first interaction with SAM by running `get_started_with_SAM.py`. This will load an example image, simulate a visual prompt by the user, and will make a prediction.

# Environment
No special libraries are needed so far.
If this:
```
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cv2
import numpy as np
import os
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import sys
```
runs, you should be fine!
